# Flash-Chat #

Flash Chat is an internet based messaging app similar to WhatsApp. I used a service called Firebase Firestore as a backend database to store and retrieve our messages from the cloud. 

Your messages are marked with the "ME" avatar, other chat users are marked with the "YOU" avatar. 

Using: 

* MVC
* Firebase
* StoryBoard
